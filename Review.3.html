        <p>At first I thought the Hunger Games was a book about kids killing kids for fun. This
        is indeed not the case for the Hunger Games triology. The books follow a girl, Katniss
        Everdeen, as she navigates her world where the totalitarian government shows the citizens
        of their power by organizing an event called the Hunger Games where two kids, a male
        and a female, from each of the twelve districts of Panem and puts them in an arena to kill each other until there is one single winner.
        Katniss volunteers to participate in the Hunger Games and takes the place of her younger 
        sinster who was chosen to compete in the games. The other competitor from her district is a boy her age named
        Peeta Mellark. During the games Peeta and Katniss form an unbreakable bond which carries 
        through the rest of the series. together, they decide to fight the totalitarian
        government by defying the rules of the game at the end. This sparks a rebellion where
        the citizens of the districts of Panem fight for there freedom. Will the rebellion succeed? Read the Hunger Games triology
        to find out I would recommend this book for teens because of some of the mature content.</p>
        
        <p>Review:</p>
        <p>I really liked this book. There were some really important life lessons that I learned from this book.
        A small act of kindness can truly change a person's life in an instant. It can be hard to trust
        people but it can be worth the effort. Strenght isn't only about how strong you are,
        it is more about how brave you are. You don't always have to put on a strong face, it's okay
        to not be okay sometimes. Don't judge a person by their looks, they may surprise you in the end. All friendships change us forever, 
        nomatter how short they are.Love, support, family, friends, with them we can win any rebellion and 
        overcome any obstacle that comes our way.</p>
