        <p>Review:</p>
        <p>What really stuck by me from this book was how both Augustus and Hazel didn't let their disease
        control them. The lived their life to the fullest and enjoyed every minute of it. The bond they fromed through books 
        was truly exceptional. It shows that if we fight we can overcome any disease. I am one of those people who believes what I see.
        I believe in the science behind things and after reading this book, I realized that the cure for cancer
        might not be medicine and drugs. Sure chemo can help, but the real cure to Cancer lies in each and every one of us
        it is the fight to live and to succeed. The fight for a future and that is what heals us.</p>
