        <p>Review:</p>
        <p>I really enjoyed this book and the movie. It was so cool to see Ender
        grow as a character. This book really shows us the drastic things fear
        makes us do. Do we really need to destroy everything that sares us?
        We should work to understand the people around us better. That's what made Ender
        such a great leader. He was able to understand his team as well as the enemy.
        His compassion helped him win the war. If we understand the people around us. We will
        be able to solve most of our problems. We should take a stand and be the change
        that influences the rest of the world to work together.</p>
