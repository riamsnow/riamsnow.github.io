        <p>The Giver truly is a literary masterpiece. 
        The book takes place in a dystopian society where
        there is no color, music, love, or memories of the past. 
        The society is run by Elders, a board of adults who make 
        decisions for the entire society. The main character, Jonas, is chosen to become
        the receiver of memories, one of the most important jobs in the society. The receiver 
        of memories is the one person in the whole society who has memories of the past. For his 
        training, Jonas meets the Giver, his teacher, who was the previous receiver of
        memories. The Giver's job is to transfer all his memories of the past to Jonas, who will
        take over his job of advising the Elders. During his journeys with the Giver, Jonas realizes 
        that his perfect society might not be so perfect as it seems. Embark with Jonas on his travels where 
        he will discover who he is and what makes us human.</p> 
        
        <p>Review:</p>
        <p>This is one of my favorite books of all time. Imagine living in a society where nobody 
        any emotions. The people are like robots. This book really opened my eyes and showed me 
        that war, anger, greed, and love are what builds us. Without memories of our past, how are
        we going to make amends in the future. Each fall, messup, and loss makes us a better person. We become
        more compassionate. Each problem in life may seem terrible at the time, but each one
        influences you. We are perfect just the way we are. If everybody understands this, we won't have
        work to solve world peace, we would already have done it. So my advice to you is to look at the
        glass half full rather than half empty, and don't get discouraged if you fall down, just pick yourself
        back up and keep walking towards your goal. Believe me, you will lose many small battles, but what matter is ifyou
        win the war.</p>
